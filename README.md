React Environment Managment Tool

This is a side project authored by myself, Sam Wylock as a way to learn new technologies while helping out my team at GE.

Some of the tech that I am using this project to learn are React.js, AWS, Redux, and Postgres.

This is still under construction so be sure to check back here for more updates.
